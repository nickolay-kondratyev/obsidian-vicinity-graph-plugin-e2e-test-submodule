 * `settingsUxVisual` each carried their own copy of `openSettingsTab` / `card` /
 * `resetButton` / `confirmDialog`, and the copies had already drifted (only two
 * of the three waited for the tab to finish rendering). One object, one behavior.
 *
 * This module is pure page automation: NO `fs`, deliberately. Every top-level
 * `e2e/*.ts` is source-scanned by `vaultTarget.test.ts` for destructive writes,
 * and the cheapest way to satisfy that scan is to have nothing to scan. Each spec
 * keeps its own `OUT_DIR` for screenshots.
