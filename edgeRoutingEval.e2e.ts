/**
 * Evaluation harness for edge routing — NOT a tight regression (that is
 * `edgeRouting.e2e.ts`). It drives the tuning fixtures with routing ON, captures a
 * screenshot per fixture to `/.out` for human/agent eyeballing of route quality, and
 * reads the routing-pass vs elk+d3-layout wall-times AND the route-quality detour
 * ratios that the controller logs at `console.debug` — proving the perf budget (the
 * routing pass stays WELL under the layout time even on the ~100-node dense fixture)
 * and giving route-quality tuning (e.g. the libavoid shape buffer) a numeric baseline.
 *
 * Fixtures come from `scripts/setup-dev-vault.sh`:
 * - sparse: `note1.md` vicinity (~9 notes, projects/solo groups).
 * - medium: `hub-medium.md` (five 3-member folder groups + inter-group ring).
 * - dense:  `zzdense-hub.md` (~110 ungrouped spokes + chords).
 * - facing: `facing/hub-facing.md` (a 5-member folder-group box approached by 12
 *   SEPARATE edges from one clustered side — the only fixture that can show the
 *   group facing-side attachment symptom; the others never crowd a group side).
 * Outgoing depth 2 is set so sibling chords are WALKED (only walked links become
 * edges) and therefore genuinely load the router.

 *

 * 1. a layout STRICTLY LARGER than the first one has been logged. {@link renderFixture}
 *    bounces through `note2.md`, whose vicinity is the smallest graph in this spec, so a
 *    bigger layout can only be the central fixture's. WHY-NOT count layouts instead: the
 *    bounce open fires "several rebuilds" exactly as described above, so a fixed count is
 *    satisfiable by bounce passes alone. Quiescence alone is not enough either: the dense
 *    fixture's elk layout takes ~1.5s, and the silence while it runs looks exactly like the
 *    end of the burst (observed: the dense row reporting the 3-obstacle bounce pass).
 * 2. no further pass for {@link SETTLE_QUIET_MS}, so a trailing debounced rebuild is in.
 *
 * ASSUMES the central rebuild is STRUCTURAL, so elk actually runs and logs. When
 * `decideLayout` returns `reuse-layout` (`src/view/GraphViewController.ts`), the pass is
 * skipped and a different, unmatched line is logged — condition 1 could then never be met,
 * which is what the throw below spells out.
