/**
 * LOCAL PINNING headline scenario, driven end-to-end through the real controls UI
 * (ticket `nid_6eust4js4l85s163nezeq3v3g_e`). A local pin pins a target ONLY in the
 * context of the current MAIN note; it makes the target a central (a root) while that
 * main is active and NEVER carries across mains. This spec exercises the whole claim:
 *
 * 1. locally pin a neighbor → it becomes a pinned central under this main;
 * 2. the DISCONNECTED case (owner decision 6): a locally-pinned note stays central
 *    even once the main no longer reaches it by any link — the pin alone keeps it in;
 * 3. switch MAIN away → the local pin does not apply, the target drops out;
 * 4. switch MAIN back → it is central again (the pin is scoped to this main, not lost);
 * 5. it survives a real Obsidian restart (the local-pin map is persisted in the
 *    per-file `VaultFileStore` — `.plugin_data/.../per_file/<main-docid>.json` — which
 *    syncs as vault content, NOT in data.json).
 *
 * A sibling of `pinnedCentralScenario.e2e.ts` (which owns the GLOBAL pin lifecycle),
 * kept apart so each spec states ONE feature's claim. SERIAL and order-dependent by
 * design: each step inherits the GIVEN of the one above it.
 *
 * Fixtures are e2e-only, ROOT-level (no folder groups to intercept pointer events) and
 * SPARSE, so React Flow's mount `fitView` keeps every node large and clear of the
 * top-left controls panel — what makes the hover/pin gestures deterministic. Every note
 * that is ever PINNED (hub as the local-pin MAIN key, plus lp_a / lp_b as targets)
 * carries a seeded `id` (stable-ids-for-obsidian's frontmatter key): a note can only be pinned
 * once it has a stable docid, and seeding models the normal steady state.
 *
 * Each also carries a DESCRIPTIVE frontmatter `title` — deliberately, not for show. Node
 * WIDTH hugs the title, and the LOCAL-pin chip is the LEFTMOST of three hover chips, so it
 * only sits INSIDE the node once the node is wide enough to hold all three (the narrow-node
 * clipping edge in docs-internal/tickets/ticket-pin-offset-centre-clearance.md). A bare
 * filename title like `lp_a` sizes the node so narrow that the chip's centre spills past the
 * node's left edge onto the pane, where a real click cannot land. The `[[lp_a]]` wikilinks
 * still resolve by FILENAME, so the titles change the rendered width only, never the graph.
