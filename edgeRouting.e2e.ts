/**
 * Visual-smoke e2e for edge routing: obstacle-avoiding routing is always on, so an
 * edge whose straight line would cross another node must render as a multi-segment
 * routed polyline (obstacle-avoiding) rather than a single straight segment.
 *
 * Fixture: a hub (`er_c`) linked to a 6-node ring (`er1..er6`) that also carries
 * three "diameter" chords (er1↔er4, er2↔er5, er3↔er6). Force layout pulls the
 * hub to the ring's centroid (it links every ring node), so a diameter chord's
 * straight line passes through the hub — a guaranteed obstacle for the router to
 * detour around. The layout is deterministic (seeded LCG in d3ForceRefinement),
 * so once a detour occurs it is reproducible, not flaky.
 *
 * Chords are sibling links between depth-1 neighbours, and ONLY walked links become
 * edges — so the fixture is driven at outgoing depth 2, where the BFS expands each
 * ring node once more and genuinely walks the chords. The ring is closed (every ring
 * link stays inside the fixture), so the second hop adds edges without adding nodes.
 *
 * Bend detector: a routed detour (>=3 waypoints) emits >=2 `L` commands in its
 * path `d`; a straight edge emits exactly one `L` and a paired bow emits none.
 * So ">=2 L commands" precisely flags a genuine obstacle-avoiding route without
 * depending on exact coordinates.
 *
 * A SECOND fixture is asserted here — `facing/` from `scripts/setup-dev-vault.sh`,
 * a folder-group box approached by 12 separate edges from one clustered side. It
 * guards a different property (which BORDER of a group box an edge attaches to)
 * that no other automated check in the repo can see; see that test's docblock.
 * It shares this file's outgoing-depth-2 driving for the SAME reason the ring does:
 * its cluster links are sibling links between depth-1 neighbours, so only the second
 * hop walks them — and without them walked there is no clustering force and no crowd.

 * (1.079 / 1.014) between an arm that attached every edge on the facing side and one
 * that wrapped edges round to the far border — because detour ratio scores route
 * LENGTH, and a wrong-side attachment barely moves it. Without this assertion a
 * regression in boundary-pin selection sails through a fully green suite.
 *
 * The property, asserted PER EDGE: each of the 12 edges terminates on a border of the
 * `facing/` box that its OWN counterpart node sits outside of — so an edge may never
 * wrap round to the far border, nor onto a flank the counterpart is not actually past.
 *
 * WHY-NOT the earlier form ("every edge attaches on the ONE side the neighbour centroid
 * lies off"): it is unachievable by construction and was red from the day it landed
 * (ticket nid_uv3al1mhaxmz37ooiit15iq0w_e). Even with the crowd formed, individual
 * neighbours legitimately settle past a FLANKING border (measured: 3 of 12 sit ~180px
 * off the left border while the centroid is above), and attaching those on the flank is
 * the CORRECT routing result — the old assertion scored it as a wrap-around. The
 * per-edge form keeps the full strictness against the real pathology (a terminal on a
 * border its counterpart is not past) without asserting a geometry the fixture cannot have.
