/**
 * Drag-to-resize e2e (ticket nid_qjsj5mth2phdqctbm0vfx9elw_e), driven through
 * the real gesture: hover a node, drag its bottom-right resize handle, release.
 * Asserted end-to-end:
 * - the released box persists as the docid-keyed override in the plugin store;
 * - the rebuilt graph renders the node at EXACTLY the persisted box (React
 *   Flow's inline style is in flow units, so it equals the override verbatim,
 *   independent of zoom);
 * - the override survives a view remount AND a central switch (it is a global
 *   fact about the doc, like a pin);
 * - the context menu's "Reset size" clears it;
 * - each grip is REACHABLE by a real pointer (the corner chip's overhanging
 *   half, and the right edge's grab band — both are geometry no unit test can
 *   see, and both have shipped broken once);
 * - the gesture's seam into React Flow stays narrow: no node ends up SELECTED.
 *
 * The override is ALSO this suite's way of putting a node at a chosen box, which
 * is why the hover pin chip's small-node behavior is asserted here (ticket
 * `nid_tclb98q9hxhmcuonamvr4ig1f_e`): the chip is revealed at every node height
 * and only withheld where it would cover the node's CENTRE point, and the sizes
 * that band applies to are not sizes a fixture graph renders on its own.
 *
 * SERIAL and order-dependent: each test builds on the state above it.
