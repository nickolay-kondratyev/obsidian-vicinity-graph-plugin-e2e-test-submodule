/**
 * The ONE e2e-side description of what the settings surfaces are made of: the
 * settings-tab cards (heading + scoped restore row, in render order) and the
 * controls-panel disclosures (in panel order).
 *
 * WHY it exists: three specs used to hand-maintain the same `toHaveCount(6)` and
 * the same 6/7-entry restore-name lists. Adding or renaming a card meant finding
 * five sites by hand, and missing one left a spec quietly asserting a stale
 * truth (`node-content-preference` hit exactly that). Every count here is
 * `<CONST>.length`, so one edit updates every site.
 *
 * WHY the reset NAMES are derived rather than re-typed: they are already
 * data-driven in `src/view/settingsResetPlan` (`label` is simultaneously the row
 * name, the button `aria-label` and the tooltip). Re-typing them here would be a
 * fourth copy. The literal second opinion that a *copy change* was intentional
 * lives in `settingsBaseline.test.ts` (one place) and in
 * `src/view/settingsResetPlan.test.ts` (label shape) — deliberately NOT removed.
 *
 * WHY nothing here re-types a heading or a panel summary any more: since the dual
 * presenters ticket both surfaces render `SETTINGS_GROUPS` (`src/view/settingsRows`),
 * so the headings, the panel order and which section opens by default ARE data. This
 * module reads them; `settingsUxVisual.e2e.ts` is what proves they reach the DOM.
 *
 * This module is pure: no `obsidian`, no `react`, no `fs`. It must stay that way
 * — `settingsResetPlan` is safe to import because it only reaches into the pure
 * engine, and pulling `obsidian` into the node-side test process crashes it (see
 * the note in `obsidianHarness.ts`).
