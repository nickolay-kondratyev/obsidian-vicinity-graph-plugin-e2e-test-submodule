/*
 * A slider whose value is nowhere on screen is unreadable, and NOTHING else in
 * this repo asserts that readout: `aria-label` and the `value` attribute both
 * survive its removal. This test exists because `setDynamicTooltip()` was once
 * deleted from `addLabeledSlider` on the strength of the `@deprecated` tag in
 * the 1.13 typings — blanking the value of all 10 sliders on every supported
 * build below 1.13 — with the whole suite green.
 *
 * Deliberately mechanism-agnostic: on the pinned 1.12.7 runtime the value lands
 * in a body-level `.tooltip` on hover; from 1.13 it renders inline in the row.
 * Either satisfies "the value is readable", so a future `minAppVersion` bump
 * needs no edit here.
 *
 * As of 2026-07-26 ONLY the `.tooltip` arm is verified: 1.13 is not GA (newest
 * public release 1.12.7; 1.13.x is Catalyst-gated), so the inline arm has never
 * run against a shipped build. Its ENTIRE basis is one line of `obsidian.d.ts` —
 * "@deprecated The value is now always shown inline next to the slider." — which
 * names no selector, no ancestry and no number formatting. It is a reasoned guess.
 * Hence the catch below: a 1.13 red is likelier a locator miss than a regression.
 *
 * Two things the assertion must NOT be satisfiable by, hence its exact shape:
 * - the `<input value=…>` attribute → match on rendered TEXT only;
 * - a digit in the row's own name/desc → scoped to `.setting-item-control`
 *   (name and desc live in the sibling `.setting-item-info`) and matched exactly.
 * And it asserts only the post-hover state — WHY-NOT a "hidden before hover"
 * precondition: from 1.13 the inline readout is there before any hover, and that
 * precondition would then fail for a reason that is not a regression.
