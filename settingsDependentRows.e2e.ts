/**
 * Ticket `nid_9k11zke41l6ze3p7n7suuo4v2_e`: the settings tab's DEPENDENT control
 * — the exclusion-patterns textarea — used to be refreshed by calling
 * `display()`, which empties `containerEl` and rebuilds all six cards. That is
 * invisible in a screenshot and invisible to every other spec, but it costs the
 * user their scroll position and their keyboard focus on every flip.
 *
 * Since `nid_qp56jugz8en8wkgjirwcb269p_e` the shape is: the dependent control is
 * always rendered and merely toggles `disabled` (declared as `disabledWhen` in
 * `src/view/settingsRows.ts`), so both tests below assert node IDENTITY across
 * the flip. (The sizing-metric weight rows this spec also covered were REMOVED
 * with the content-fit sizing rework, nid_cx5zoz7ptucg9nxalibv0mbjb_e —
 * exclusion patterns is now the only `disabledWhen` row.)
 *
 * So each test here asserts the same three things across ONE toggle, and they are
 * the only assertions that can tell a targeted update from a rebuild:
 *  1. `document.activeElement` is still the control it was;
 *  2. the tab's scroll offset is unchanged;
 *  3. an UNRELATED row's DOM node is the SAME node (see {@link IDENTITY_PROBE}).
 *
 * A SEPARATE spec from `settingsUxVisual.e2e.ts` on purpose: that file is serial
 * and its tests hand state to each other, while these need a deliberately scrolled
 * and focused tab as their GIVEN.
 *
 * Screenshots → `.out/settings-dependent-rows/` (never source-controlled).
