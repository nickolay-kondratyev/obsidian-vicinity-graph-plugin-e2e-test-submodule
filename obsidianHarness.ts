/**
 * Launches a REAL Obsidian (Electron) on a throwaway copy of `.dev-vault`,
 * fully sandboxed from any system Obsidian install.
 *
 * Opt-in override: with `VICINITY_E2E_VAULT` set, Obsidian opens THAT vault in
 * place instead (see `vaultTarget.ts`) — no copy, no wipe, no fixture writes.
 *
 * Connection: Obsidian is spawned with `--remote-debugging-port=0` and the
 * suite attaches via `chromium.connectOverCDP` to the "DevTools listening on
 * ws://…" endpoint the app prints on stderr.
 * WHY-NOT Playwright's `_electron.launch`: it additionally needs the Electron
 * MAIN process's node inspector (`--inspect=0`), which Obsidian's packaged
 * build ignores (Electron fuses), so `_electron.launch` hangs until timeout —
 * verified against Obsidian 1.12.7. All our automation is renderer-level
 * (locators + `window.app`), so browser-level CDP is sufficient.
 *
 * Sandbox mechanism (mirrors what `obsidian-launcher` does, verified in its
 * source — WHY we don't depend on it: plain Playwright covers our one launch
 * scenario without a second launcher framework):
 * - `--user-data-dir=<sandbox dir>` isolates Obsidian's own config; a
 *   pre-written `obsidian.json` registers the vault with `open: true` so the
 *   app boots straight into it (no vault picker) and `updateDisabled: true`
 *   stops auto-update traffic.
 * - `--no-sandbox` on Linux: Electron's SUID chrome-sandbox is unavailable in
 *   most CI containers (electron/electron#42510).
 * - Community plugins are enabled AT RUNTIME via `app.plugins.setEnable(true)`
 *   instead of pre-seeding Chromium's localStorage leveldb (WHY-NOT: seeding
 *   requires a leveldb writer dependency for zero extra value here).
