/**
 * Repro harness for "the graph looks wrong in MY vault": drives an arbitrary
 * vault (`VICINITY_E2E_VAULT`) in place, opens one note in it
 * (`VICINITY_E2E_NOTE`) and screenshots the graph to `.out/` for eyeballing.
 *
 * NOT a regression test — it asserts only that a graph renders, because the
 * vault's content is unknown. It SKIPS entirely when the vault var is unset, so
 * the default suite is unaffected.
 *
 * Safety: the harness never writes into that vault (no copy, no wipe, no
 * fixtures). Obsidian itself still writes `.obsidian/workspace.json` and the
 * plugin's `data.json` there — see the README caveat.
