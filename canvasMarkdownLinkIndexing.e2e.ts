/**
 * OBSERVES what real Obsidian core itself puts in `metadataCache.resolvedLinks`
 * for MARKDOWN-STYLE inline links written in a canvas TEXT node.
 *
 * WHY this spec exists: the fallback canvas parser
 * (`src/adapters/CanvasFallbackParser.ts`) harvests those links so that the two
 * canvas link regimes agree (ticket `nid_ygo7h95ssgmunaqsprc1zlmfh_e`). "Core
 * reports them" is the PREMISE of that whole design, and every unit test of it
 * hand-seeds `resolvedLinks` — so no unit test can falsify the premise. This one
 * can: it is the only place where the `core-indexed` side is measured rather
 * than assumed. If it goes red, the fallback is emitting edges core never emits
 * and the design is inverted, not merely buggy.
 *
 * Deliberately launches with its OWN `extraFixtures` under `md-links/` instead of
 * touching `.dev-vault`: the shared fixtures' node/orphan counts are asserted to
 * the unit by `vicinityGraph.e2e.ts`, and this observation needs neither the
 * plugin's rendering nor its settings.
