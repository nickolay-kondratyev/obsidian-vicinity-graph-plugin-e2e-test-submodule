/**
 * THE debounce-window pattern for e2e specs that TYPE into a settings field —
 * the one thing no spec had before ticket `nid_ek3wrqoh1rsftk6ulg836mghf_e`,
 * because every other spec writes through `harness.save*` and therefore never
 * meets {@link SETTINGS_WRITE_DEBOUNCE_MS}.
 *
 * A typed settings edit does not persist when the keystroke happens: it persists
 * when `DebouncedSettingsWrites` drains its shared settle window (400ms after the
 * LAST keystroke in any typed row). So a spec has two distinct questions, and only
 * one of them is a plain poll:
 *
 * - "did this edit land?" → {@link expectPersisted}: poll the store until it does.
 *   Web-first, no timing assumption at all.
 * - "did this edit NOT land?" → an ABSENCE claim, which no poll can settle. This is
 *   exactly where a spec is tempted to sleep for `SETTINGS_WRITE_DEBOUNCE_MS + margin`
 *   — a magic wait that passes for the wrong reason on a slow machine and hides the
 *   race it is papering over. {@link drain} answers it by ORDERING instead.
 *
 * WHY-NOT reach into the tab's own `settlePendingWrites()` through `page.evaluate`:
 * it would be deterministic, but it replaces the window under test with a barrier of
 * our own making — the spec would then prove that an explicitly flushed write behaves,
 * not that the DEBOUNCE does.
 *
 * Pure page automation, no `fs` (see the note in {@link SettingsTabPage}).

	 * an unrelated typed row and polls until THAT value is stored. Seeing the sentinel
	 * land proves the shared window opened after the edit under test and drained — a

	 *
	 * CONTRACT, for the specs told to copy this pattern:
	 * - PRECONDITION: the settings tab is OPEN with the sentinel row rendered and
	 *   enabled. Called with the window closed, this cannot type and instead hangs
	 *   until the `expect` timeout, reporting a missing sentinel rather than the truth.
	 * - It bars the TAB's `DebouncedSettingsWrites` only. An edit made in the in-graph
	 *   controls panel rides a different instance and is NOT covered by this barrier.
	 * - It MUTATES a real setting: `sizing.{@link SENTINEL_FIELD}` flips between the two
	 *   {@link SENTINEL_VALUES}. Harmless while nothing asserts on that field — a spec
	 *   that does assert on it must seed it after the last `drain()`.
