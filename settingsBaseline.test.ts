/**
 * The INDEPENDENT second opinion on `settingsBaseline`'s DERIVED copy.
 *
 * The e2e specs now assert restore-row names against values read out of
 * `src/view/settingsResetPlan`, which on its own would make a copy change
 * self-fulfilling: rename a label and every spec would happily follow it. These
 * literals are the pin that says "this rename was deliberate" — exactly the
 * strength the three specs used to carry, now in ONE place instead of five.
 *
 * WHY-NOT pin the hand-written parts too (card headings, disclosure flags): a
 * literal here asserting a literal one file over has no independent authority —
 * it just makes a rename a two-file edit, the duplication this module removes.
 * Their real pin is the DOM: `settingsUxVisual.e2e.ts` asserts the headings and
 * the disclosure states against a real Obsidian.
 *
 * Runs under `npm test` (vitest), not Playwright: nothing here needs Obsidian.
